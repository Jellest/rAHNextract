<!-- badges: end -->

Extract elevation points or areas of the Netherlands from the Actueel Hoogtebestand Nederland (AHN) using R. Raster or point clouds extraction is possible of a custom area for the AHN1, AHN2 or AHN3 using the different PDOK. geo services.

Works with all available resolutions. Works with Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and Digital Surface Model (DSM).

Available raster points or datasets to download through this package:
AHN1:
AHN2: 0.5 m and 5 m resolutions; both DSM and DTM. 0.5 m DTM also makes distinction between interpolated raster dataset or not)
AHN3: 0.5 m and 5 m; both DSM and DTM

Available point cloud datasets:
AHN1: uitgefilterd en gefilterd
AHN2: uitgefilterd en gefilterd
AHN3: 
## Installation

You can install the released version of rAHNextract from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
#>install.packages("rAHNextract")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("Jellest/rAHNextract")
```
## Example


```{r AHN point(s)}
library(rAHNextract)
#
indiv_elevation <- ahn_point(name = "water side", X = , Y = , AHN = "AHN3", resolution = 0.5)

#Use mapply to calculate AHN for more than 1 point.
my_points <- read.table(file = "scratch/coordinaten_Zwaanshoek.csv", header = TRUE, sep=",")
elevation_points <- mapply(ahn_point, name = my_points$ID, X = my_points$X, Y = my_points$Y, AHN =  "AHN3", resolution = 0.5)
results_table <- data.frame(my_points, elevation_points)
colnames(results_table) <- c("ID", "X", "Y", "elevation")

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{AHN raster areas}
#WCS method
##circle

#BBOX



#sheets method
##custom shape


#All geometry type can be applied for both the WCS and sheets method.
```

```{AHN point clouds}
#WCS method

#sheets method


```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}

```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
